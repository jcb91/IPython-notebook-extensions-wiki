Installing the extension adds a new button to the toolbar:

After clicking the button, the notebook width is reduced and static help panel is displayed at the right side:

The contents of the help panel are exactly the same as when going to `Keyboard Shortcuts` in the `Help` menu.
Limitations
-----------
Currently, there are some limitations:
* the help panel may disappear for certain window widths
* there is no way to customize the help panel contents for now
