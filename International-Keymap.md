This extension adds new keybindings for the functions comment/uncomment and indent/dedent. This is necessary, because the default key-bindings are not accessible on a non US-keyboard. Furthermore, this extension resolves the problem that the move-cell-up/down keybindings won't with most browsers.

The new Key-bindings are:

'Alt-3': toggle_comments
'Alt-2': dedent_selection
'Alt-1': indent_selection
'Shift-k': move-selected-cell-up
'Shift-j': move-selected-cell-down
