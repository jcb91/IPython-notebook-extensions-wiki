__NB Try the newer [Collapsible Headings](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions/tree/master/nbextensions/usability/collapsible_headings) extension__. These extensions intend to provide collapsible sections in the notebook, separated by heading cells. However, the Hierarchical Collapse extension has been dormant for some time, and has a bunch of bugs. For the same functionality, plus more options and fewer bugs, try [Collapsible Headings](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions/tree/master/nbextensions/usability/collapsible_headings).

Allows us to hide all cells below the selected heading. This extension is still very much in testing.
