__This nbextension was removed from the `master` branch in
[ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions#507](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/507)
in favour of the newer
[Collapsible Headings](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tree/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions/collapsible_headings) extension__.

~~Allows us to hide all cells below the selected heading. This extension is still very much in testing.~~
