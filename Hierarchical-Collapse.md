__This nbextension was removed from the `master` branch in
[ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions#507](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions/pull/507)
in favour of the newer
[Collapsible Headings](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions/tree/master/nbextensions/usability/collapsible_headings) extension__.

~~Allows us to hide all cells below the selected heading. This extension is still very much in testing.~~
