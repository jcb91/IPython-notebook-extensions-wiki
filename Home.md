The IPython/Jupyter notebook functionality (i.e. what you do with the Browser) can be extended using Javascript extensions. This repository contains a collection of such extensions. The maturity of the provided extensions may vary, please [create an issue](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions/issues/new) if you encounter any problems.
